#### iMMEr is a language immersion tool that I created for the CS50 final. It utilized googles translate function to take something would normally search for in your native language and translate it for you. The purpose is to encourage people to find things that are fun and might hold your attention so that you will spend more times practice that languages you want to learn.

# Usage
## Search bar
#### Enter your query into the search bar. Any language may be used. The application is set to autodetect through the googletrans API.

## Language Selection
#### Select your target language from the drop-down menu. Once the data is sent. This will let the googletrans API know which language to translate your query to.

## GO button
#### This is self explanatory. This submits the data you have input and that app will filter through the results and return a page of links related to your query. Since your query has been translated, these results should in most cases be all in your target language. 
#### Alternatively, you may use the enter button on your keyboard or other compatible periphery device to submit your query if either the search field or the button are selected. 

## A note on scraping...
#### Scraping can be a controversial topic. There is no attempt to hide that these links are being scraped from google. The intent of the eMMIr application is for educational purposes only. Some google links are altered in the process as a matter of aesthetics.
