# immersearch

#iMMEr is a language immersion tool that I created for the CS50 final. It utilized googles translate function to take something would normally search for in your native language and translate it for you.

#The purpose is to encourage people to find things that are fun and might hold your attention so that you will spend more times practice that languages you want to learn.
